# Haskell symbolic core

This is the experimental native observation and checking boundary for the typed symbolic
engine migration. It does **not** replace AgdaProver's current search engine.
There is no search operation or default-engine switch yet.

## Build and inspect

From the AgdaProver checkout:

```sh
scripts/build-symbolic-core
scripts/build-symbolic-core --print-path
```

The build requires GHC 9.6.7 and installed Agda 2.8.0/aeson 2.2.4.1 packages.
`AGDAPROVER_AGDA_PACKAGE_DB` overrides the package database location. Builds are
offline and refuse to silently rebuild Agda. Build output stays in the ignored
`dist-newstyle` directory. No development repository or corpus is needed.

The resulting executable accepts:

```text
agdaprover-symbolic capabilities
agdaprover-symbolic observe ABSOLUTE-FILE GOAL MODE [ABSOLUTE-INCLUDE ...]
agdaprover-symbolic session ABSOLUTE-FILE [ABSOLUTE-INCLUDE ...]
```

Use a prepared project copy and ordinary process supervision for observations.
Modes are `raw`, `instantiated`, `head-normal`, `simplified`, and `normalized`.
Agda checks the source under its declared options. No library registry is
discovered implicitly; imports use explicit include roots and Agda's primitives.
Agda may generate normal import interfaces in that copy.

For `observe`, stdout is one JSON response; progress and diagnostics go to stderr. A checking or
unsupported-observation failure has a nonzero exit status. An observation is
never a verified proof and never edits goal bodies.

## Resident checking

`session` loads once and reads newline-delimited JSON requests. It supports
observations, speculative `give`, retained branches, eviction/replay, cost
snapshots, cancellation, and close. It does not choose candidates or solve goals
autonomously. See [the session protocol](../../schemas/symbolic-session-v1.md)
for fields, events, resource supervision, and failure semantics.

All requests address a session/epoch/branch key. A successful check returns a
different child key and keeps its parent unchanged. Hidden metas and remaining
constraints are not mistaken for completion. Even `apparently-closed` is only
provisional checking evidence, not an independently verified proof.

Source and loaded-import changes invalidate the epoch. Use immutable prepared
project copies for runs. The initial implementation conservatively rechecks
exact source bytes around each native operation; it claims no whole-search
speedup yet. Cancellation restores the parent without resetting work counters.
An evicted branch can be replayed, but replay issues new keys rather than
silently changing the meaning of old checked evidence.

## Boundaries

- `core/`: compiler-independent typed protocol declarations; no Agda internals.
- `adapter/`: Agda 2.8 types, scoped snapshots, and structural codecs.
- `app/`: process entrypoint and response/error framing.

Terms remain Agda's typed Haskell syntax inside the adapter. Their JSON trees
are observations, not a second typechecker or authority for proof acceptance.
The codec preserves eliminations, binders, annotations, levels, and known metas.
It rejects unknown atom references and unbound indices during reconstruction.
Dummy nodes and reflection meta literals currently produce explicit unsupported
observations. Names and metas are session-local, not reusable external handles.

The context telescope stays raw, independently of the requested target view.
Scope aliases are resolved by Agda, with ambiguous/unknown names retained as
such. Full native scopes and local let bindings remain in the scoped snapshot.
Structural round trips are not conversion proofs or fresh validation.

The codec is shared with development tools through an annotation-view provider.
Older development snapshots retain their presentation format; the runtime view
also preserves domain-name provenance. No training, benchmark, or library-specific
dispatch code belongs here.

Action generation, NNUE execution, search, and engine selection are subsequent
migration tasks. Current search and model bytes remain
unchanged until those tasks are qualified.
